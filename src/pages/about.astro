	<p>
		Hey, I'm <strong>Criss</strong> — an AI educator, developer, and content creator based in Latvia.
	</p>

	<p>
		I teach kids and adults about AI, build software projects, and create content about the
		cutting edge of artificial intelligence on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe AI should be accessible to everyone — not locked behind jargon and paywalls.
		Whether I'm giving lectures, building automations, or writing about my latest experiments,
		the goal is always the same: <strong>make technology work for people</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I share my adventures — the wins, the fails, and the "what was I thinking"
		moments. If you're curious about AI and want honest takes instead of hype, you're in the right place.
	</p>
